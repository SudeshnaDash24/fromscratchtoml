            <LI>To document every bit of code and make it easy to understand.
            <LI>To bridge the gap between the theoretical and coding aspects of machine learning algorithms.
            <LI>To write [intuitive blogs as python notebooks](https://jellaifish.github.io/fromscratchtoml/showroom/) so as to juxtapose theory and code. Explaining the fundamentals of the algorithm from the very basics.
            <LI>To minimise the use of external dependencies except the fundamental ones like `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
            <LI>To make sure that the developed algorithms are coherent with already existing machine learning frameworks.
            <LI>And above all - to be a one stop repository for understanding almost all the basic machine learning algorithms.
