*An intuitive machine learning library for beginners, in python.*  
This library targets individuals who want to learn machine learning code from scratch keeping _code-readability_ and _simplicity_ over efficiency.

## Goals
 - To document every bit of code and make it easy to understand.
 - To bridge the gap between the theoretical and coding aspects of machine learning algorithms.
 - To write [intuitive blogs as python notebooks](https://jellaifish.github.io/fromscratchtoml/showroom/) so as to juxtapose theory and code. Explaining the fundamentals of the algorithm from the very basics.  
 - To minimise the use of external dependencies except the fundamental ones like `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
 - To make sure that the developed algorithms are coherent with already existing machine learning frameworks.
 - And above all - to be a one stop repository for understanding almost all the basic machine learning algorithms.

## Installation
#### Python pypi <a name="pypi"></a>
You can install from [pipy](https://pypi.org/project/fromscratchtoml/).

    pip install fromscratchtoml

This is the most stable build.


#### Compiling manually <a name="manual"></a>
If you are interested in installing the most bleeding edge but not too stable version. You can install
from source -  

    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    git clone https://github.com/jellAIfish/fromscratchtoml.git
    python setup.py install

## Tutorials and support
* Well documented API usage is available at [pydoc](https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/fromscratchtoml-0.0.1/)
* For discussion and support visit - [the gitter channel](https://gitter.im/jellAIfish/from-scratch-to-ml)
* Development discussions and bugs reports can be tracked on [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellAIfish/fromscratchtoml/issues).

## Future endeavours
* This library will form a back-bone for teaching and guiding budding machine learning developers via vBlogs.
